## Development work
To do development you need to star the `MediaSet.Api` as well as the `MediaSite.Remix` projects.

To start `MediaSet.Api`:
- VSCode: can be by pressing `F5` or by staring the debugger from the debug menu. Make sure `MediaSet.Api` is select in the debugger dropdown.

This will launch a browser window to http://localhost:7130/swagger/index.html to display the swagger API.

To start `MediaSet.Remix`:
- CommandLine/Terminal: run `npm run dev` from the `MediaSet.Remix` folder.

You can now navigate to http://localhost:5173 in a browser and will be brought to the home page of MediaSet.
